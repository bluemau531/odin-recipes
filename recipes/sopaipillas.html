        <p> <b> Ingredients: </b></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> 9 ounces zapallo squash </li>
                <li>4 Â¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>10 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 cups canola oil for pan-frying</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!-- Step by Step-->
        <p> Directions:
            <ol>
                <li> Peel, seed, and cut zapallo into chunks.
                    Place in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
                    Cook until zapallo is soft and easily pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
                    Drain and allow to cool slightly.</li>
                <li> Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl, and set aside.
                    Stir together squash and melted butter. Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until blended.
                    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft and satiny, adding a little more flour if necessary.
                    Cover dough with a towel and allow to rest 15 minutes.</li>
                <li> Roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick, and cut into 3-inch diameter circles.
                    Poke each circle a few times with a fork to make holes and prevent rising.</li>
                <li> Pour oil into a large, deep skillet and heat over medium-high heat until hot, 385 degrees F (195 degrees C).
                    Place several of the dough circles into hot oil; cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
                    Drain on paper towels. Cook remainder of dough circles in batches.</li>
             </ol>
