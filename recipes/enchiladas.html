        <p> <ol>
                <li> Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>                
                
                <li>
                    Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                    Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef 
                    is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                    Drain and discard grease.</li>
                
                <li> 
                    Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, parsley, 
                    taco seasoning, oregano, and black pepper into ground beef 
                    until cheese is melted. Mix in enchilada sauce, chili powder, 
                    garlic, and salt; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 
                    until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>

                <li>Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon 
                    about 1/4 cup meat sauce down the center of tortilla. 
                    Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black beans and a 
                    sprinkling of black olives. Roll up tortilla, 
                    enclosing filling; lay seam-side down in a 9x13-inch 
                    baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>

                <li>Spoon any remaining meat sauce over rolled tortillas. 
                    Scatter any remaining black beans and black olives over the top. 
                    Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>

                <li> Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, 20 to 22 minutes. 
                    Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
                
                <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
            </ol></p>
